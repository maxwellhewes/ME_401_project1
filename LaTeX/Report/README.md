# Overleaf Instructions
## General Idea:
The final report for project 1 is a collaborative worksheet. The report is formatted and partially written to present a detailed context of the intended outcome for this project as well as being a resource for Project 2.

Feel free to change / tweak the template to suite your needs, but know that it is intended as a scaffolded resource that each group can complete, you do not need to start from scratch.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

- open a new document in your overleaf account.
- copy 'main.tex' from the github page to the overleaf page
- in the overleaf page, create a new file using the button located on the top left window, name it 'references.bib', copy the matching file from the github page to the overleaf document. This is how citations and references are accomplished in 'LaTeX' most websites will have an option to copy a .bib reference for peer reviewed articles. Those can be added to this file and the software will handle the rest. (the references will need to be updated)
- lastly, using the same upper left window, there is an option to upload files. This is how .png file can be uploaded for figures. Formatting options for figures can be found in the "Results" section of the template
- If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to max.
