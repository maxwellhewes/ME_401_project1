 
% The .bib file contains all your bibliographic data in a structured format.
% Each entry has a unique citation key (e.g., "smith2022") that you reference
% in your document using \cite{smith2022}.
%
% LaTeX processes the .bib file through BibTeX, which:
%   1. Reads your \cite{} commands in the document
%   2. Looks up matching entries in references.bib
%   3. Formats them according to IEEEtran style
%   4. Generates a numbered reference list (e.g., [1], [2], etc.)
